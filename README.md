**NFL Down and Distance Simulator**

The NFL Down and Distance Simulator is a Java program designed to accurately display the ball's position on the field. In this interactive simulation, users assume the role of a coach, wishing to test the accuracy and efficiency of the simulator.

Players have the flexibility to input their chosen plays and the yards gained during each attempt. The simulator accurately calculates downs and distances, providing a dynamic experience that mirrors real-life football scenarios. Additionally, the program incorporates special conditions, such as first downs, turnovers on downs, and red zone situations, adding depth to the simulation.
